### IMF Terms
- **[[000 Index|Index]]** - This is where it all begins. It's the most root-level of all your notes. It's the most meta. Nothing outranks the Index. 
	- **[[Intro to the Index Categories (IMF)|Index Categories]]** - These are your 10 or so main categories of personal knowledge. Each category should have a link to a related Content Map.
- **[[MOCs (Maps of Content) - Intro|Maps of Content]]** - A flexible contrast to a Table of Contents (TOC). A TOC has one linear, hierarchical structure. Conversly, the same info can be structured if completely different ways with Maps of Content. This is because they are [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Heterarchy|heterarchical]] by nature. 
	- **MOC** - An acronym for "Map of Contents". See [[MOCs (Maps of Content) - Intro]]. A side benefit of using "MOC" in the title is that it stands out visually and provides much better search results. 
- **[[IMF Fluid Frameworks|Fluid Frameworks]]** - Any helpful "on-call" structure that helps, but doesn't hinder note retrieval and management. They are adaptable changlings, fitting your changing needs. (See [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Fluid Taxonomies]] for more.)
- **Zettel** - The German word for "Zettel" roughly translates to "Note" in English. The connotations with zettel are distinctly connected to knowledge management. It's helpful to think of a zettel as a unit of thought.
- **IMF** - An acronym for "Index, Maps, and Frameworks", which represents three non-load-bearing structures existing within this digital library.


### Other Terms
- **PKM** - "Personal Knowledge Management" - The process of individuals making, using, organizing, connecting, combining, collaborating, and creating with their personal notes.
