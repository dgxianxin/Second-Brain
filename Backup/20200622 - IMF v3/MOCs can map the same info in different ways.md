# MOCs can map the same info in different ways
Maps of Content (MOCs) are inherently flexible. Check out (4) different MOCs I created using the exact same 19 concepts for different purposes.

This type of awesome relational/positional thinking doesn't happen with a rigid table of contents.

## (Example 1) Daily Reminders
Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/OODA Loop]], [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Levels of Magnification]], and [[Contextual Lenses]].

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/_pHabits/Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Flow]], which involves environmental  [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Shadow Clone]]. 


[[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/_pHabits/Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Lindy Effect]], along with [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Hormesis]] and [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Antifragility]]—and also more broadly [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Cause and Effect]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Ying and Yang]], [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Synthesis]], [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Seasons]].

Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/The Id]]. [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Aikido]] is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanded my narrowed perspectve, try to revisit the [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[Charlie Munger's Mental Models]].
