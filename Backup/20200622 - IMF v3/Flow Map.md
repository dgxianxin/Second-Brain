# Flow Map
The [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Flow Map]] is Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's way to describe where [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Flow]] takes place in regards to the variables: Challenge and Skill. However he came about plotting the two variables against each, it's a landmark discovery. It's a lodestar to which I keep returning. It's the foundation much of my thinking and to my carving of that theory to practical, moment-to-moment application.

Later on, Dr. Mihaly used this version to show the different states of mind plotted on the map of Challenge vs Skill.

### What is my Contribution to Flow Theory?

My contribution to Flow Theory is just to expand on using the Flow Map as a practical tool to adjust one’s state of mind as needed—usually to create the [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Conditions of Flow]] ([[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/FlowCreation Theory]]).

Basically, Mihaly’s Flow Map can be used many times a day as a simple tool to identify one’s current state of mind. That’s the easy part.

The second part is all about how to take that knowledge to improve one’s state of mind—ideally by getting closer to a feeling of a high quality experience—what Mihaly calls “optimal experience,” which is none other than Flow.

So you can use the Flow Map as a "State of Mind" Map—a useful guide to manage your state of mind from moment to moment.

1. Find your current state of mind—Maybe ask, "What am I feeling?" or "Where's my head at?"
2. Create the [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Conditions of Flow]]—This is where we can develop some [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/FlowCreation Theory]] skills and tactics. 

Say, someone is anxious: they can point to "Anxiety" on the Flow Map and then have a few ideas how to get closer to "Optimal Experience" (Flow). See below:

The obvious answer for creating the [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Conditions of Flow]] is to reduce the level of Challenge or to increase the level of Skill (as the map above shows).

The less obvious answer is *HOW*. That's about developing some awareness and skills, along with having some tools and tactics handy. See more about that at [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/FlowCreation Theory]].
