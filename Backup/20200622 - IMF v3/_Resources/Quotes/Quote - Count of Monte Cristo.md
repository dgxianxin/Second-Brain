Captivity brings light to the treasures of the human intellect, just as compression is needed to explode gunpowder. From the collision of clouds electricity is produced; from electricity, lightning; from lightning, illumination."* - from The Count of Monte Cristo


Captivity, compression, collision... concentration, density, tightly-packed

light, spark, explode, electricity, lightning, illumination
