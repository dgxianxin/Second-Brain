## Mental and Digital Clean-up
* Do you find yourself looking for a we-worded, informational, or important digital (or written) document? Depending on what you do, this might happen to you often. And with each passing day, week, month, and year of accumulating information; it's only getting worse. The mind is terribly weak (even as it is awesomely impressive). It's a paradox of strength and weakness. It needs a helping hand. The Mental and Digital Clean-up is the answer. 
	* The MDCu is another mental touch, another strand to aid in relocating the file, another chance to relate it to other files and thoughts, therefore acting to "*triangulate*" the information - the ultimate key to memory.
	* Without the MDCu, you're fighting a battle you can't win. There is a certain hubris to our in-the-moment mettle for memory, but that's only the Top-of-Mind effect. Once new events, stimuli, interactions, and tasks take center stage; those unforgettable moments show their slippery side - and our mind shows its fallible, sieve-like nature. 
	* Top of Mind information isn't shelved away neatly into memory. It's just the top of the trash can. It's right there, prominently on display. But wait a while and soon it will be out of sight. And as they say, "Out of sight, out of mind." It's the unbelievably true law of our emotions and memories. (That's why recalling important memories is so crucial to continuing to remember them.)


	* That's why knowledge is power.
	* The real definition of Education is: knowing what to do to get what you want.
	* Not too far from an "educated" mind is a powerful one: Power is: the ability to get what you want.
	* It's hard to be powerful if you don't first know *how* to get what you want.  Therefore, a highly organized mental and digital space is essential to be able to call upon the information you need to make informed decisions, develop ideas, and recall events - when you need to - quickly and cleanly.
	* With the constant increase in accumulated information, being able to process, catalogue, and retrieve information will be a key factor between either finding success and fulfillment in life, or constantly searching for it :) 


#### How do I organize my tasks? My schedule? Do I have a system I trust? Am I preventing tasks from falling through the cracks? 
If you are spending too much time trying not to forget everything you need to do, you need to look into forming a better system. Some people go the other extreme and over-organize their tasks into a beautiful system of projects, tasks, and sub tasks. They spend so much time organizing their tasks, they exhaust the energy to actually get any of them done!  

* When it comes to task management, no "one size fits all." Just remember the overall goal: "to get things done effectively and efficiently with the most peace of mind."

That brings us back to the initial question. In essence: *When I wake up, how can I best generate strong momentum?* Again, there is never a "one size fits all," but there are two golden habits that I cannot recommend enough.



* It's all about strengthening the strands to the things that matter most: the memories, habits, friendships, and relationships that add to the tapestry of a fulfilling life.
