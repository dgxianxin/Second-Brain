# Folders - A Cheat Sheet
Too many folders is a problem. Everyone agrees. But the new problem is the reaction: "No folders!" That's dogmatic. Dogma leads to atrophy. Therefore, let's consider some basic uses of folders. (This is a draft note.)

For daily notes
For projects
For idea incubation
For resources
For privacy

Daily Notes
- It's nice to have a place to capture notes effortlessly. But these notes are not evergreen yet. So it makes sense if you want to keep them separate. 
- I use the folder `_Dailies`
- I prefer the `_` underscore so it always sorts to the top.

Projects
- If you want to use plain-text for more than just evergreen notes (I do), then how do you keep temporary project notes (of limited long-term value) separate from your evergreen notes? 
- I sometimes will use a project folder. An example is `_pHabits_`
- I prefer the `_p` prefix so it always sorts near the top and next to other project folders.

Temporary Incubators
- If you want to keep so half-formed notes together in one area, sometimes it's nice to "physically" throw them in one temporary folder. I use the same `_p` notation, but I suppose `_i` could work too.

For Resources
- This is the most needed place for a folder structure. 
- When a Thing is so strongly associated with one category, it can make sense to make that category its own folder. Examples that I use include:
	- Images
	- People
	- Quotes
	- Source Materials (not PDFs at this time)

For Privacy
- It's nice to have a place for things like Finances, Health-related notes, and private notes.
- I use the folder `_zBackend`
-  I prefer the `_z` prefix so it always sorts near the top but below all the other folders.
