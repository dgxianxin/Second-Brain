# Tags - A Cheat Sheet
Tags are either action-based or descriptive. Both are useful.

Action-based examples: #reduce #stub 
Descriptive examples: #source #notes #concepts #people #quotes

### Action-based Tags
- #reduce (or `#diverge #prep #annotate #flavor #cut`)
	- Action: Read and process the outside, source material, then remove the tag
	- Description: chew, trim, extract, distill, curate, and otherwise process the note
		- If you copied a lot of text (and don't need to cite the text verbatim), delete the passages you don't need
		- If you were more selective and copied only the relevant stuff, find related assertions and group them in a new note with a makeshift bad title, like "benefits of sleep on reaction time.
			- If you need (or want) to save the original material for citing, then copy and paste into the new note, otherwise it might be better to cut and paste to eliminate the digital noise.
	- Placement: So where do the new notes go? Three possible places: 
		1. The main note collection
		2. In an "incubation" folder (short-term solution) (While the folder isn't strictly necessary, I've found it somewhat helpful for project-like areas.)
		3. In an MOC
- #stub (or `#seed #stray #editme #refine`)
	- Action: Get the new note above 50%, then remove the tag
	- Description: The note is either just a placeholder, or it has some descriptions, but doesn't have a basic level of unique commentary. After the note feels 50% complete, get rid of stub tags.
	- Placement: 
		- If you are done with it for now, throw it into your main note collection. 
		- If you want to continue working on it, you can keep it in an incubation folder. Or just make sure it's in an MOC when you throw it into your main note collection.


### Description-based Tags
#source - anything substantial copied from outside sources. 
#notes - are anytime you have a bunch of your own comments or annotations on outside source material
#source #notes - this is a powerful search to unearth files of source material that also have your annotations.
