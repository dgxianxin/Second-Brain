Check out the four different ways the same (19) concepts have been organized. Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these conceptual collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas.

## Concepts MOC - Daily Reminders
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections...

*A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism recognized and given a name.*

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/OODA Loop]], [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Levels of Magnification]], and [[Contextual Lenses]].

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/_pHabits/Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Flow]], which involves environmental  [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Shadow Clone]]. 


[[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/_pHabits/Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Lindy Effect]], along with [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Hormesis]] and [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Antifragility]]—and also more broadly [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Cause and Effect]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Ying and Yang]], [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Synthesis]], [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Seasons]].

Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/The Id]]. [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Aikido]] is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanded my narrowed perspectve, try to revisit the [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[Charlie Munger's Mental Models]].
