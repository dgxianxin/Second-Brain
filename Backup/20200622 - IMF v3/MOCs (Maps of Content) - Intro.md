# MOCs (Maps of Content) - Intro
- Step 1: Understand the paradigm of Maps of Content (MOCs): a game-changing thinking tool for knowledge management. 
- Step 2: Use MOCs to deepen and accelerate your ideation to greater levels.

## Why use MOCs
- MOCs relieve anxiety by allowing you a space to place related notes together
- In that space, MOCs create an environment that encourages concentrated ideation: the rapid interact, exchange, and development of thoughts, notions, and ideas.
- *After* you've developed an MOC you're happy with, it becomes the template for whatever project you need to complete: an essay, a product, a summation of thought on a topic.
- The MOC remains as a reliable navigational tool to the rest of your digital library.
- The MOC also acts as a reminding tool on a subject. Years later you can quickly return to it and remember, "Oh I remember now, that's what I thought about the how the evolution of fonts related to the broader movements of Art History!"
- The MOC remains ready to evolve as your thoughts grow, mature, develop complexity on a subject. 
- MOCs maintain their fluidity: As opposed to folders, MOCs are nondestructive, non-restrictive, non-limiting perspectives. Unlike a folder, you are not forced to use them to access your notes. MOCs are “overlays” that add relevant information but that don't affect the base content. 
- MOCs allow for limitless flexibility: Unlike folders or Table of Contents (TOC), MOCs are not hierarchical. They are [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/Heterarchy|heterarchial]]. This means that, [[MOCs can map the same info in different ways|multiple maps organizing the same info in different ways]] to fit whatever persepective the note is for. 
- MOCs encourage "Relational Positioning": Don't argue with the Ancient Greeks and Romans about the value of spatial relationships. It helps us remember better when ideas are not floating in isolation, but as a part of a spatial constellation.[^1]

## When to use MOCs
Whenever you start to feel that tickle of overwhelm, that's when you need to *become a cartographer of your own content* and create a new MOC. 

For example, let's say you have 20 scattered notes on the project you’re making. Just like putting 20 index cards on an inviting rustic workbench, putting links to all 20 notes into a new MOCs is the digital equivalent.

MOCs help you overcome *Mental Squeeze Points* and the dreaded "Project Slowdown".
- What is a mental squeeze point? It's when your unsorted knowledge becomes so messy it overwhelms and discourages you. Either you are equipped with frameworks to overcome the squeeze point, or you are discouraged and possibly abandon your project. This is usually followed by yet another search for the next app that will make all the difference. 

> *The ability to know when and how to make an MOC is a key skill in overcoming overwhelm and project slowdown*.

## How to use MOCs
Maps of Content fill more purposes than initially meet the eye. Here are [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/_pMOCs/The 3 phases of MOCs]].

(1) [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/_pMOCs/Habits MOC - Assembling Phase|Assembling Phase]]: Imagine having a warehouse of limitless workbenches, and for each workbench you curate the notes placed on it. Whenever you feel you need to get a handle on a bunch of notes Subject XYZ,  just throw them all onto a new workbench—i.e. place their links into a new MOC note titled `Subject XYZ MOC`. Now it's easier to begin.

(2) [[Backup/20200622 - IMF v3/_pMOCs/Habits MOC - Colliding Phase|Colliding Phase]]: Once you have all your ideas in one MOC, use it like a crucible where ideas can battle it out for positioning, forcing you to grind them to their fundamental essence—thinking of their proximal importance to each other and building stronger connective tissue between them. Great work is accomplished during in this conceptual battleground. The product of this work is rarely one without satisfaction.

(2b) As you position these related notes, you might naturally form something that looks like a Table of Contents (TOC). TOCs are specific and linear. Depending on the project, you might need one as you get closer to a final product.
- **Map of Content = MOC** - Use these as a thinking tool and to structure your digital library
- **Table of Contents = TOC** - Use these to structure more specific, near-final projects in a single, linear way

(3) [[Habits MOC - Unifying Phase|Unifying Phase]]: As you finish work on an area of interest, the MOC remains as a renewable summation of thought for the future you. An MOC is your easy access point back into the topic—whether that's tomorrow or in ten years. 

> In this way, the usage intensity of an MOC can mimic a 3-act structure: Setup, Confrontation, and Resolution.

The underlying principle was the Method of Loci (loci being Latin for "places"), which is a strategy of memory enhancement by visualizing familiar spatial environments to improve the recall of information.
