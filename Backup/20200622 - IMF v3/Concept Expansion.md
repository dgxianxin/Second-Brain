# Concept Expansion
Take a word, any word, and just start using it in different ways. Each new instance expands our sense of the word.

Here's [[Speech - Analogy as Core– - Hofstadter2009]]'s example of shadow: a shadow from the sun…then a snow shadow…then a rain shadow…a familial shadow…in the shadow of a big event…the gulf stream. Suddenly instead of a tree casting a shadow on the ground, it's England casting a shadow on the northern parts of Scandanavia. 

This is a bigger concept than first meets the eye. It's a sneaky rhetorical device that's used all the time. Be careful not to overuse it yourself. A good example of being caught up in your own overuse is "someone's" rigid insistence on using the term "Barbell Method" inaccurately to describe reading something once lightly, and a second time more deeply.
