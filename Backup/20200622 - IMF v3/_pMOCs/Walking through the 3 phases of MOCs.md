# Walking through the 3 phases of MOCs
So, grand promises have been made about utilizing MOCs and you want to unlock this superpower. How does it begin?

In the real world it looks like this: you read something interesting on a topic—let's say on "habits"—and you make a note. 

Later on, you make a couple more notes on the same topic. Hmm, you say, "I'm starting to worry I might lose some of these ideas." 

So to pass this "Mental Squeeze Point"[^1] you go ahead and make a new special note. 

You call it `Habits MOC`. (But we'll call it three different things, only for the sake of this walkthrough.) 

Now click on the assembling phase below...

[^1]: A "Mental Squeeze Point" is when your unsorted knowledge becomes so messy it overwhelms and discourages you. Either you are equipped with frameworks to overcome the squeeze point, or you are discouraged and possibly abandon your project. This is usually followed by yet another search for the next app that will make all the difference.
