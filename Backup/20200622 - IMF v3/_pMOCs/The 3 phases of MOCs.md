# The 3 phases of MOCs
Maps of Content are dynamic thinking, growing, and creating tools. They have three basic stages in a full lifecycle. 

1. **Assembling Phase**: *Collect, Curate, Incubate* - Put related stuff on a new digital workbench.
2. **Colliding Phase**: *Battle, Collide, Dismember, Combine, Craft, Discover* - Have your ideas battle for relational positioning. This is the most joyous and valuable stage.
3. **Unifying Phase**: *Enjoy and Use* - Enjoy the spatial constellation you created out of concepts. It most likely is meaningful to you. Use it for different purposes: for final products (content creation), as a reference point in the future, or for the inherent joy the ideas provide.
