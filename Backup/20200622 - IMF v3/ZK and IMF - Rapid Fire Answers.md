Let's get on the same page...

Q: What is a zettelkasten?
A: A zettelkasten is a thinking and writing tool comprised of a big collection of small notes, highly linked.

Q: Is that it?
A: No, there's more... It's a growing web of personalized thoughts that helps you find associations between ideas that you weren't intentionally looking for.

Q: So it's like a second brain?
A: Yes. You are Dr. Frankenstein and the zettelkasten is the monster you're creating. Except instead of being scary, your zettelkasten is a dynamic and surprisingly fun conversation partner. 

Q: Hmm, that's interesting.
A: More than you know...

Q: Why should I care about a zettelkasten?
A: Do you want your notes to give you value, not just in the short-term, but forever?
Do you lose ideas? Do you have trouble combining ideas? Are you notes scattered everywhere? Are you drowning in too much information? Have you lost the signal from the noise? If you answered yes to any of these, read on.

Q: I'm still reading...So, who benefits from having a zettelkasten?
A: People who write and think a lot. People who don't want to forget important ideas. People who develop ideas. People who value the ability to build upon their knowledge over years instead of letting it slip away to the ravages of time.

Q: Give me specific types of people please.
A: Students, academics, and life-long learners...makers, content creators, essay-writers, and bloggers...Non-fiction and fiction writers...

Q: What is IMF? 
A: IMF stands for Index, Maps of Content, and other fluid Frameworks. Although it's mainly associated with index and maps, so you can think of it as the "Index and Maps Framework". See [[IMF Intro]].

Q: So IMF competes with zettelkasten?
A: No. IMF is a framework that works alongside a zettelkasten. It enhances how you write, think, and navigate with your zettelkasten. 

Q: Please further explain this relationship between IMF and ZK.
A: The IMF works *on top* of a zettelkasten.  It's not a system, it's a framework you apply to your zettelkasten. If you follow the principles of small notes, linked to other notes, re-written in your own words—then you have some form of a zettelkasten. Using the IMF doesn't change that; it just adds an optional layer to enhance writing, thinking, and navigating.

Q: How does the IMF help with writing, thinking, and navigating?
A: In several synergistic ways. Because it provides comforting, reliable navigation; it lowers anxiety. Because it's flexibility, it allows for non-rigid thinking. The list of benefits is deep. See [[Benefits of IMF]] 

Q: Do I need the IMF?
A: No you don't, especially when you have less than a couple hundred notes. But you may want it. You'll know if you do. It's starts with a growing sense of anxiety and overwhelm...Like a vampire thirsting for blood, you'll find yourself gravitating toward a the creation of your first MOC, so you can work with several notes at the same time. See [[Is IMF For Me]].

Q: What's an MOC?
A: An MOC stands for "Map of Content". MOCs may be the most important thinking tool you can use with your zettelkasten. [[MOCs (Maps of Content) - Intro]]

Q: How would you describe Maps of Content? 
A: An MOC is just a note where you collect a bunch of related notes, then you stare at it, and think.

A: The Index and MOCs are just one package of frameworks for PKM (Personal Knowledge Management). The others can be broadly put into the categories of folders, tags, direct links, and relative positioning. All are useful tools when used for the appropriate problems.
