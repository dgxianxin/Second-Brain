# MOCs encourage flexible non-destructive thinking
MOCs allow for flexible idea rearrangement because you can map the same bits of information in completely different ways.

Take a second to unpack what's going on here. This highlights a profound but underappreciated aspect of MOCs. 

> MOCs allow for limitless interpretations. The only limit is your imagination.

Check out (4) MOCs below. They all use the exact same 19 concepts, but for different purposes. This type of awesome relational/positional thinking doesn't happen with a rigid table of contents.

## (Example 1) Daily Reminders
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections!

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[Main/OODA Loop]], [[Main/Levels of Magnification]], and [[Main/Refraction Thinking]].

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[Main/Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Main/Flow]], which involves environmental  [[Main/Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[Main/Shadow Clone]]. 


[[Main/Umami/Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[Main/Lindy Effect]], along with [[Main/Hormesis]] and [[Main/Antifragility]]—and also more broadly [[Main/Cause and Effect]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[Main/Ying and Yang]], [[Main/Synthesis]], [[Main/Seasons]].

Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[Main/No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[Main/The Id]]. [[Main/Aikido]] is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanded my narrowed perspectve, try to revisit the [[Main/Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[Main/Munger's Mental Models]].
