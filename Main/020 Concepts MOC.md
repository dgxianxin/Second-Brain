# Concepts MOC
*A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism recognized and given a name.*
Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these conceptual collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas.

## Concepts MOC - Daily Reminders
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections!

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[Main/OODA Loop]], [[Main/Levels of Magnification]], and [[Main/Refraction Thinking]].

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[Main/Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Main/Flow]], which involves environmental  [[Main/Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[Main/Shadow Clone]]. 


[[Main/Umami/Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[Main/Lindy Effect]], along with [[Main/Hormesis]] and [[Main/Antifragility]]—and also more broadly [[Main/Cause and Effect]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[Main/Ying and Yang]], [[Main/Synthesis]], [[Main/Seasons]].

Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[Main/No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[Main/The Id]]. [[Main/Aikido]] is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspectve, try to revisit the [[Main/Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[Main/Munger's Mental Models]].
