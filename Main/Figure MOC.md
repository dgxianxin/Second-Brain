# Figure MOC
Figurative language represents a broad swath of rich expression. If quotes are one half of a commonplace book, then metaphors, allusions, and allegories are the other half. 

- [[Main/Metaphor MOC]] - metaphors paint a picture
- [[Main/Allusion MOC]] - allusions indirectly reference something
- [[Main/Allegory MOC]] - allegories symbolically represent an idea or concept, i.e., Moby-Dick can represent the object of a person's all-consuming obsession
